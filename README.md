Welcome to Bookify. 

The idea of this app is to be a Book listing app which includes full CRUD functionality and RESTfull routing. 

This app runs with Rails backend and a React.js frontend.

To start up the back end, clone down bookify-backend and run rails s. Then go to localhost:3001

To run the frontend end, clown down bookify-frontend and run npm start. Localhost:3000 should open automatically. 

To navigate through the app: You may start by clicking on New Book. After filling out the information you will be brought to the index page. From there you may click on any book and be brought to its show page. From there you may edit or delete the book.

Hope you enjoy. Thank you!
